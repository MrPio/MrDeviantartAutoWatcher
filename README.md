# MrDeviantartAutoWatcher
Simple script to automate the process of subscription in [deviantart.com](www.deviantart.com).

### Just positionate on a deviant art post with a lot of favourites ad make sure the star icon is visible on the screen scrolling down a bit if needed, then start the script. ENJOY YOUR NEW WATCHERS!

#### Note that if you need to use dark theme on the site or just change the picture in the /ui folder with your own, by making a simple screenshoot.

#### Note also that Deviant art will prevent ypu to pooling watch action for too long. So either increase the sleep time in the script, or try again after some time.
